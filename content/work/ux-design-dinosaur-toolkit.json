  "description": "The Dinosaur Toolkit was a project that leveraged SUE, the largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex specimen discovered, in an interactive learning environment.",
  "overview": "The Learning Center at The Field Museum was developing a digital toolkit about dinosaurs and geologic time that educators across the country could use in the classroom. The problem space presented to us was extremely open, the only anchor to this project was that we had to incorporate the bone scans of SUE, the largest and best preserved T-Rex ever discovered. This was both extremely exciting and scary, as we only had about 9 weeks to complete the project.<br/>\nDue to time constraints coupled with the open nature of the project, our designs weren't as fleshed out as we wanted them to be. However, our research and initial design ideas set the foundation in which The Field Museum can build upon.",
  "details": "# Process\n\nWe first conducted a competitive analysis to gain knowledge of what products are currently on the market and to get initial ideas for our own toolkit. We then did user research to get a more concise understanding of the basic requirements our interface. We went about this by talking with our client, creating a survey, and sending it out to a set of teachers that had previously been helpful in providing feedback to the museum about teaching toolkits. Additionally, we developed user personas and journeys to identify pain points in the teaching and learning experience for our users which will be addressed in our initial design of the toolkit.<br/><br/>\n\n# Research\n\nWe conducted a survey with 8 educators from the Chicago area to learn basic demographic information as well as understand what teachers find exciting and what they think will lead to engagement of their students.<br/><br/>\n\nThe survey helped us come to the conclusion that our target demographic is middle school students, and that we should aim to create a flexible web application that can be easily adapted to lesson plans with activities that can be done individually or in a group of students together.\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Primary Persona Jeff](/img/jeff-persona.png \"Primary Persona Jeff\")\n\n![Primary Persona Gwen](/img/gwen-persona.png \"Primary Persona Gwen\")\n\nWe created two personas meant to represent the two kinds of users of The Field Museum's toolkits. The personas were originally created using the qualitative responses of teachers from The Field Museum’s Biomechanics Toolkit survey.\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Jeff User Journey](/img/jeff-journey.jpg \"Jeff User Journey\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Gwen User Journey](/img/gwen-user-journey.jpg \"Gwen User Journey\")\n\n<br/><br/>\nTo accompany these personas, we created user journeys to illustrate how each of the users may act and feel when completing an activity in the current state.\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Requirements\n\nFrom our research, we were able to come up with concrete requirements to help structure our project.\n\n<div class=\"pt-4 flex flex-col md:flex-row text-center md:text-left\">\n<div class=\"w-1/3 md:pr-6 pr-0 pb-10 md:pb-0 self-center md:self-start\">\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">UX</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalable solution using one or two dinosaurs.</li>\n<li class=\"py-4\">Students can work together and share the device or work independently and have an equivalent experience.</li>\n<li>Allow students to learn through exploration rather than direct instruction.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"w-1/3 md:px-6 px-0 pb-10 md:pb-0 self-center md:self-start\">\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">CONTENT</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It should include activities that meet the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) learning objectives so that it is a viable solution for teachers to use as a tool to supplement lesson plans.\n</li>\n<li class=\"pt-4\">Activities must be flexible to easily adjust for a variety of lesson plans</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"w-1/3 md:pl-6 pl-0 pb-10 md:pb-0 self-center md:self-start\">\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">TECHNICAL</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Must be a web application.</li>\n<li class=\"py-4\">Must be light enough to operate on hardware with low CPU capabilities.</li>\n<li>Integration of Sketchfab platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Ideation\n\n![Ideation Sketch Dinosaur and Platforms](/img/dino-sketch.jpg \"Ideation Sketch\")\n\n<br/>\nWe began our ideation phase by sketching as many potential ideas for our web app as we could in 2 minutes, and then discussed what we had come up with. We had many ideas we liked, such as a “race through time” idea, where users saw how dinosaurs evolved into birds, or possibly a puzzle where students would piece Sue’s skeleton back together while getting to examine their bones’ functions more closely.\n<br/><br/>\nAfter coming up with all these ideas we quickly realized that our activities needed to be more closely related, as we were all across the board. We also knew that the activities had to relate to content that would actually be taught in the classroom, as we wanted the end product to be useful and relevant.\n<br/><br/>\nThis is when we decided that we needed to be more focused on hitting points brought up by the NGSS. After examining the topics that NGSS aims to teach, we decided that the wanted our activities to focus on evolution and natural selection. We had another brainstorming session where we asked questions related to these topics. In addition to deciding what we wanted to teach, we knew that we also needed to create a place where any and all activities could be accessed. We came up with the idea to create a landing page with floating islands that link to multiple activities.\n<br/><br/>\n\n# Ideation\n\nThe storyboards were helpful not only in fleshing out our design ideas, but more importantly in critically thinking through how our designs would exist in the classroom environment. We based the interactions off of our research and were later validated with our client visit.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Dino Toolkit Part One: Structural Similarities](/img/storyboard-1.png \"Dino Toolkit Part One: Structural Similarities\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">activity 1 // \"bone battle\"</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\nWe began creating storyboards of our ideas once we identified the two learning objectives that we wanted to focus on. The first serves to illustrate the concept of evolutionary development by examining the anatomical similarities between SUE the T-Rex and a modern animal, the turkey. Our design involves the teacher facilitating a discussion with students to help them hypothesize which bones or body parts in each animal may be structurally similar, and then using the first screen in our tool to visually identify how the wishbone, leg bone, and feet bones are structurally similar between the two animals.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Dino Toolkit Part Two: Form and Function](/img/storyboard-2.png \"Dino Toolkit Part Two: Form and Function\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">activity 2 // \"function fight\"</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\nOur second learning objective is around the idea of function and natural selection. The activity to teach this objective is similar to the previous one but starts with the exploration of the environment we created in the second screen of the tool. From here, students will be encouraged to explore our environment and discuss what the 3 bones from the previous activity may have helped the animal do or accomplish. The teacher will then use the tool and go through each bone one by one in our environment and show visually how the bones were used by each animal to accomplish the same or a different task. For example, the wishbone in the T-Rex was used for holding prey, whereas the turkey uses it for flight.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h2>Client Visit // Participatory Design Workshop</h2><br/><br/>\n\n![Participatory Design Workshop](/img/workshop-1.jpg \"Participatory Design Workshop\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWe were lucky enough to have the opportunity to go to Chicago to meet our client. While at the museum, we were able to explore the museum and learn more about dinosaurs and see other exhibits that became toolkits. We were also able to talk to a paleontologist to verify that research we had gathered about dinosaurs is accurate.While at the museum we also ran a participatory design workshop where we shared our storyboards with 8 teachers from around the Chicago area. In a 1-hour session, we shared our design rationale for each storyboard with the educators and asked them to provide feedback on the design and the content for each activity.\\\n‍<br/><br/>\n\n![](/img/workshop-2.jpg)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">feedback and insight</h3>\n\n<br/>\n\nThe teachers were very positive overall about the ideas we presented in the storyboards. That said, they did give feedback that they would like to see more cross-disciplinary content. We discussed the possibility of adding a ratio activity and using narrative to build language arts skills. One teacher also brought up a concern that some students might not be particularly familiar with turkeys other than at Thanksgiving. We discussed the possibility of giving more background information about turkeys or other birds before letting a student begin an activity. <br/><br/>\n\n# Ideation\n\nThe homepage consists of a background of Sue the T.rex standing in a Jurassic environment. Above is The Field Museum’s logo and the title of the toolkit. Each of the “island” graphics are clickable and represent another page with SketchFab models embedded into it. One island represents form and function, and another represents structural similarity. <br/><br/>\n\n![Dinosaur Toolkit Concept 1](/img/concept-1.png \"Dinosaur Toolkit Concept 1\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere are other islands with the label “Coming Soon” which represent additional content for The Field Museum team to develop and implement.There are two islands that were built out in this design, “Bone Battle” and “Function Fight.” Each has a specific activity that teaches a different concept centered around a SketchFab screen. After the activity is completed, there is a summary page that reinforces what was taught before taking the user back to the homepage.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n![Dinosaur Toolkit Activity 1](/img/activity-1.png \"Dinosaur Toolkit Activity 1\")\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOur digital design is heavily based off of our storyboards and the insights gained from our client visit/participatory design workshop. Our goal for the interface of the homepage was to provide a visually attractive preface to the SketchFab environments. The island design easily facilitates additional content, and if islands are added to fill the current screen there would be a horizontal scroll bar that would allow for as many islands as needed. The islands themselves can contain anything that the museum sees fit, but in the case of this prototype, we designed them around the SketchFab screens.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n# User Testing\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">demographics</h3><br/>\n\nWe conducted user testing with three participants, all age 12 and in the 7th grade. All participants had a limited knowledge of dinosaurs and turkeys in terms of their anatomy and evolution before testing with the digital prototype. None of the participants especially liked science or history as subjects but enjoyed doing hands-on activities in class. This matched the characteristics of our student persona very well. We tested all three participants together in a focus group and asked them to complete tasks and answer questions as they interacted with the prototype. <br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">test design</h3><br/>\n\nFor our validation study, we wanted to evaluate participants’ interest to engage with our design. In addition, we wanted to make sure the titles of our activities were clear in presenting what each activity would be. In general, we wanted to validate that our design was fun, interesting, and clearly presented the learning objectives we are trying to teach.<br/><br/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"text-left\">\n\n## The three research questions that we focused on to evaluate these goals:\n\n## 1. Do the names of the islands communicate the idea of learning about dinosaur bone structure and bone function?\n\n## 2. Are the activities interesting and informative?\n\n## 3. What things are missing from the toolkit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div> <br/><br/>\n\nThe metrics used to help answer these questions were more qualitative in nature as we used small focus group testing as our primary form of validation. Due to the small sample size of this tests, traditional statistical analyses would not be able to yield significant results. Therefore, the metrics we used included quotes from the participants about their thoughts on a given activity, whether certain activities were confusing or clear to the participants, and if they were able to grasp the learning objective presented.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">analysis</h3><br/>\n\nThe results from the user testing left us with two key findings. The first was that we were able to confirm the finding that students may need more background info about birds from our user testing with the teachers in Chicago. Our student test participants felt that the descriptions of our activities were lacking clarity. They understood the learning objectives but did not understand how to get to the conclusions using the 3D models after reading the descriptions. They didn’t have the background knowledge necessary to come to the conclusions naturally. We recommend that The Field Museum pay special attention to developing the descriptions of the activities so that they provide sufficient background knowledge of dinosaurs and chickens as well as pose questions which encourage the students to explore and make appropriate conclusions. <br/><br/>\n\nThe second thing we found was that the name of our second activity did not make sense to any of the testing subjects. They believed it was related to robots or fighting between animals, which was not our intended meaning of comparing evolutionary adaptations of T-Rexes and turkeys. We changed the name of this activity to “Adaptation Attack” to meet this need. <br/><br/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"font-bold pb-1\">design changes</h3><br/>\n\nBased on both the clients’ and user testing group’s thoughts on our digital design, we improved upon a few areas in our final design. In terms of the feedback from the user testing group, the name Function Fight did not clearly communicate the learning objective the activity was supposed to present. Therefore, we changed “Function Fight” to “Adaptation Attack” to create a much stronger connection to the evolutionary concepts we were trying to teach in the activity. <br/><br/>\n\n\n\n![Design Revision](/img/revision.png \"Design Revision\")\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOur client also made suggestions about the style of our design. The first thing was removing the Field Museum logo from the activity pages. They also wanted the darker green background of the activity pages to be changed to white. Lastly, they also asked us to change the typeface used to Helvetica.\n\n<div class=\"py-24 md:py-4\"></div>"

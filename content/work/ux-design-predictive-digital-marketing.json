  "description": "RentPath is  a digital marketing solutions company that manages a brands like apartment guide, rent.com, and rentals.com. It helps renters advertise their properties and renters find their home. We partnered with RentPath as analytics consultants to improve their ability to effectively advertise on behalf of their clients.",
  "overview": "With a goal of improving the efficiency of RentPath's digital marketing solutions we built a machine learning model to predict which customers would be most likely to convert if retargeted. Our model would save RentPath an estimated 1.77 million a year in marketing costs by improving retargeting efforts. In addition we performed a cluster analysis in order to help RentPath better understand and identify potential market segments within its property management clientele.",

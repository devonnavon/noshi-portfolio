  "description": "We helped an English school in Japan transition into online education by developing an e-learning platform in addition to proposing new services that extend outside of their traditional schooling.",
  "overview": "Global Language Institute is a private English school in Japan that was looking to revitalize their business by expanding into the online learning space. Previously, they were a fairly traditional school, mainly earning revenue through school contracts. GLI would send their teachers out to schools all across Japan to teach English. However, with COVID in addition to the difficulty of generating new leads they wanted to shift their business priorities. <br/><br/>\n\nWe not only proposed a transition into e-learning but also an additional focus on teaching English to business's as well, providing English training to companies with a global presence."
